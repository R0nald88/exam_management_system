# Accessing Activity 2 - Source Code
Go to folder "activity_1_source_code" for related documents, where:
- JavaDoc folder stores the JavaDoc html export from IntelliJ. Open the index.html to view the documentation webpage.
- coverage.png stores the screenshot of the coverage report. As UI components are unable to test, the coverage could be less than 65%. However, we ensure that we have tested all functions related to database and data structure with which coverage is bigger than 65%.
- unit_tests.png stores the screenshot of the report of unit testing.
- Task_1_Sample.pdf, Task_2_Sample.pdf and Task_3_Sample.pdf stores the screenshots of execution of the application showing sample input and output and the supplementary notes of 3 different tasks.
